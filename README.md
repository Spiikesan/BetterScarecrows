## Features

Repair broken scarecrows by :
* Allowing them to attack
* Allowing them to forget you if you are far enough
* Enable grenade throwing (via the original ConVar halloween.scarecrows_throw_beancans, defaults to true)
* Set the delay between grenade throwing (via the original ConVar halloween.scarecrow_throw_beancan_global_delay, defaults to 8). There is also a 10% chance to throw.
* Repair their life. Note that multipliers doesn't work anymore so they have a little bit more life by default.
* Repair they reach distance.
* Repair their sounds (note: The chainsaw is still silent)

Improve scarecrows by :
* Allowing them to roam like animals. No more dormant zombies !
* Attacking when they are attacked. They respond to try to stay alive, and are not "passive" anymore if hit when they didn't see you.
* Flee from non human threat that are attacking them (like cactus). They will not have time to escape turrets, tho.
